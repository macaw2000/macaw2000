#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jeremy Rule and I lead Partner & Expert Services at GitHub. 

Things I do at GitHub:

1. [Expert Services](https://github.com/services) - engineers to help your organization adopt and gain business value from GitHub
2. [Partner Channel](https://partner.github.com/) - our awesome partners we work with around the world to drive customer outcomes
3. [Certifications & Accreditations](https://resources.github.com/learn/certifications/) - In 2024 you can get GitHub Certified! 
4. I also have [a small team of engineers](https://www.halopedia.org/Orbital_Drop_Shock_Troopers) that work on super challenging issues and help shape our products. 

For fun, I enjoy learning new technologies. I wrote a bot in Python to help with our weekly Dungeons & Dragons game and I also have been working through tutorials on writing rogue-like games. I play cello in a string band called [Tinkham Road](https://www.tinkhamroad.com) where we perform Northwest folk music. 

I live in a log cabin at Snoqualmie Pass which is in the Cascade Mountains in the Western USA. We are home to some of the most snowfall in the world. I have a 200 pound (90kg) St. Bernard that enjoys all the snow.
